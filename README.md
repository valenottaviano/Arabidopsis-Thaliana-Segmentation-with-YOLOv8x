# YOLOv8x-seg Model for Arabidopsis Thaliana Image Segmentation

The YOLOv8x-seg model is a deep learning model for image segmentation of Arabidopsis Thaliana individuals. It consists of 401 layers and has a total of 71,751,811 trainable parameters and 71,751,795 trainable gradients. The model is capable of processing images with a computational cost of 344.5 GFLOPs.

## Model Architecture

The YOLOv8x-seg model is based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture, which is a popular deep learning approach for object detection and segmentation tasks. The YOLOv8x-seg model takes input images and applies a series of convolutional and pooling layers to extract relevant features. These features are then used to generate bounding boxes for the objects in the image and to segment the objects from the background.

## Dataset

The YOLOv8x-seg model was trained on a dataset of images from the Sylvarum lab of Arabidopsis Thaliana individuals. The dataset was carefully curated to include a wide range of images with varying lighting conditions, angles, and plant growth stages. The dataset was annotated by expert botanists to provide accurate segmentation labels for each image.

## Performance

The YOLOv8x-seg model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Arabidopsis Thaliana image segmentation task, with an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.95 on the validation set. The model has been extensively tested on a variety of real-world images and has demonstrated robustness and accuracy in various scenarios.
